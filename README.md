# CU-Professional-README-Generator

## Description

In this project, I created a README-Generator that automatically creates itself from the command line. The program (index.js) prompts the users various questions that will be taken as inputs, and from those inputs, will generate a professional README that utilizes various logos associated with the individual inputs.

## Developer-Notes

The project was very tedious. And while the coding aspect was pretty easy and we had a mini-project that was literally the same, obtaining links for each licenses definitely took a big chunk of my time!

## User-Story

AS A developer,

I WANT a README generator,
SO THAT I can quickly create a professional README for a new project.

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input,

WHEN I am prompted for information about my application repository,
THEN a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions.

WHEN I enter my project title,
THEN this is displayed as the title of the README.

WHEN I enter a description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions,
THEN this information is added to the sections of the README entitled Description, Installation, Usage, Contributing, and Tests.

WHEN I choose a license for my application from a list of options,
THEN a badge for that license is added near the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled License that explains which license the application is covered under.

WHEN I enter my GitHub username,
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with a link to my GitHub profile.

WHEN I enter my email address,
THEN this is added to the section of the README entitled Questions, with instructions on how to reach me with additional questions.

WHEN I click on the links in the Table of Contents,
THEN I am taken to the corresponding section of the README.

## Installation

The README generator can be run locally by cloning or forking this repository.

This application also needs the usage of Node.js (20.14.0).

To check if you have node installed, use "node --version".

If you do not have node installed, you can download the latest version of node here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager.

After node is installed, use "npm install" to install all dependencies you need to run this application correctly!
