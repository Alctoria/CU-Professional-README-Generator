# CU-Professional-README-Generator

## Description

In this project, I created a README-Generator that automatically creates itself from the command line. The program (index.js) prompts the users various questions that will be taken as inputs, and from those inputs, will generate a professional README that utilizes various logos associated with the individual inputs.

## Developer-Notes

The project was very tedious. And while the coding aspect was pretty easy and we had a mini-project that was literally the same, obtaining links for each licenses definitely took a big chunk of my time!

## Video-Installation-Demo

Here is the Video-Installation

## Installation

The README generator can be run locally by cloning or forking this repository.

This application also needs the usage of Node.js (20.14.0).

To check if you have node installed, use "node --version".

If you do not have node installed, you can download the latest version of node here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager.

After node is installed, use "npm install" to install all dependencies you need to run this application correctly!

Run node index, and input all information that you need in your README!

Your result, in preview, should look like this beauty!
